# # üê∂ Using Transfer Learning and TensorFlow 2.x to Classify Different Dog Breeds
# 
# Who's that doggy in the window?
# 
# Dogs are incredible. But have you ever been sitting at a cafe, seen a dog and not known what breed it is? I have. And then someone says, "it's an English Terrier" and you think, how did they know that?
# 
# In this project we're going to be using machine learning to help us identify different breeds of dogs.
# 
# To do this, we'll be using data from the [Kaggle dog breed identification competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/overview). It consists of a collection of 10,000+ labelled images of 120 different dog breeds.
# 
# This kind of problem is called multi-class image classification. It's multi-class because we're trying to classify mutliple different breeds of dog. If we were only trying to classify dogs versus cats, it would be called binary classification (one thing versus another).
# 
# Multi-class image classification is an important problem because it's the same kind of technology Tesla uses in their self-driving cars or Airbnb uses in atuomatically adding information to their listings.
# 
# Since the most important step in a deep learng problem is getting the data ready (turning it into numbers), that's what we're going to start with.
# 
# We're going to go through the following TensorFlow/Deep Learning workflow:
# 
# 1. Get data ready (download from Kaggle, store, import).
# 2. Prepare the data (preprocessing, the 3 sets, X & y).
# 3. Choose and fit/train a model ([TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub), ¬¥tf.keras.applications¬¥, [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard), [EarlyStopping](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/EarlyStopping)).
# 4. Evaluating a model (making predictions, comparing them with the ground truth labels).
# 5. Improve the model through experimentation (start with 1000 images, make sure it works, increase the number of images).
# 6. Save, sharing and reloading your model (once you're happy with the results).
# 
# For preprocessing our data, we're going to use TensorFlow 2.x. The whole premise here is to get our data into Tensors (arrays of numbers which can be run on GPUs) and then allow a machine learning model to find patterns between them.
# 
# For our machine learning model, we're going to be using a pretrained deep learning model from TensorFlow Hub.
# 
# The process of using a pretrained model and adapting it to your own problem is called **transfer learning**. We do this because rather than train our own model from scratch (could be timely and expensive), we leverage the patterns of another model which has been trained to classify images.

# ## Get data ready (turn it into tensors)
# 
# With all machine learning model,s our data has to be in numerical format. So that's what we'll be doing first: Turning our images into tensors (numerical representation).
# 
# Let's start by accssing our data and checking out the labels.

# %%
# Checkout the labels of our data
import pandas as pd
labels_csv = pd.read_csv("labels.csv")

# Let's view an image
from IPython.display import Image

# %% [markdown]
# ### Getting images and their labels
# 
# Let's get a list of all of our image file pathnames.

# %%
# Create pathnames from image ID's
filenames = ["train/" + fname + ".jpg" for fname in labels_csv["id"]]

# Check the first 10
filenames[:10]

# %%
import os
os.listdir("train/")[:10]

# %%
# Check wheter number of filenames matches number of image files
if len(os.listdir("train/")) == len(filenames):
    print("Filenames match actual amount of files!!! Proceed.")
else:
    print("Filenames do not match actual amount of files, check the target directory.")

# %%
# One more check
Image(filenames[9_000])

# %%
labels_csv["breed"][9_000]

# %% [markdown]
# Since we've got our training image filepaths in a list, let's prepare our labels.

# %%
import numpy as np
labels = labels_csv["breed"]
# labels = labels_csv["breed"].to_numpy() does the same as below
labels = np.array(labels)
labels, len(labels)

# %%
# See if number of labels matches the number of filenames
if len(labels) == len(filenames):
    print("Number of labels matches number of filenames")
else:
    print("Number do not match!")

# %%
# Find the unique label values
unique_breeds = np.unique(labels)
unique_breeds[:10], len(unique_breeds)

# %%
# Turn a single label into an array of booleans
print(labels[0])
labels[0] == unique_breeds

# %%
# Turn every label into a boolean array
boolean_labels = [label == unique_breeds for label in labels]
boolean_labels[:2], len(boolean_labels)

# %%
# Example: Turning boolean array into integers
print(labels[0]) # original label
print(np.where(unique_breeds == labels[0])) # index where label occurs
print(boolean_labels[0].argmax()) # index where label occurs in boolean array
print(boolean_labels[0].astype(int)) # there will be a 1 where the sample label occurs

# %%
print(labels[2])
print(boolean_labels[2].astype(int))

# %% [markdown]
# ### Creating our on validation set
# SInce the dataset from Kaggle does not come with a validation set, we're going to create our own.

# %%
# Setup X & y variables
X = filenames
y = boolean_labels

# ## Preprocessing images (turning images into Tensors)
# 
# To preprocess our images into Tensors we're going to write a function which does a few things:
# 1. Take an image filepath as input
# 2. Use TensorFlow to read the file and save it to a variable, `image`
# 3. Turn our `image` (a jpg) into Tensors
# 4. Normalize our image (convert color channel values from 0-255 to 0-1)
# 5. Resize the `image` to be a shape of (224, 224)
# 6. Return the modified `image`
# 
# ### Before we do, let's see what importing an image looks like

# %%
# Convert image to NumPy array
from matplotlib.pyplot import imread
image = imread(filenames[42])
image.shape, image.max(), image.min()

# %%
# Turn image into a Tensor
tf.constant(image)[:2]

# %% [markdown]
# Now we've seen what an image looks like as a Tensor, let's make a function to preprocess them.

# %%
# Define image size
IMG_SIZE = 224

# Create a function for preprocessing images
def process_image(image_path, img_size=IMG_SIZE):
    """
    Takes an image file path and turns it into a Tensor

    # Read in an image file
    image = tf.io.read_file(image_path)
    # Turn the jpg into numerical Tensor with 3 colour channels (Red, Green, Blue)
    image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image, channels=3)
    # Convert the colour channel values from 0-255 to 0-1 values
    image = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(image, tf.float32)
    # Resize the image
    image = tf.image.resize(image, size=[img_size, img_size])

    return image

# ## Turning our data into batches
# 
# Why turn our data into batches?
# 
# Let's say you're trying to preocess 10_000+ images in one go... they all might not fit into memory.
# 
# So that's why we do about 32 (this is the batch size) images at a time (you can manually adjust the batch size if need be).
# 
# IN order to use TensorFlow effectively, we need our data in the form of Tensor tuples which look like this:
# `(image, labels)`

# * The input shape (images shape in the form of Tensors) to the model
# * The output shape (images labels in the form of Tensors) of the model
# * The URL of the model to use

# Now we've got our inputs, outputs and model ready to go, let's put them together into a Keras deep learning model!
# 
# Knowing this, let's create a function which:
# * Takes the input shape, output shape and the model we've chosen as parameters.
# * Defines the layers in a Keras model in sequential fashion (do this first, then this, then that)
# * Compiles the model (says it should be evaluated and improved)

# ## Creating callbacks
# 
# Callbacks are helperfunctions a model can use during training to do such things as save its progress, check its progress or stop training early if a model stops improving.
# 
# We'll create two callbacks, one for TensorBoard which helps track our models progress and another for early stopping, which prevents our model from training for too long.
# 
# ### Tensorboard Callback
# To setup a TensorBoard callback, we need to do 3 things:
# 1. Load the TensorBoard notebook extension ‚úÖ
# 2. Create a TensorBoard callback which is able to save logs to a directory and pass it to our model's `fit()` function. ‚úÖ
# 3. Visualize our models training logs with the  `$tensorboard` magic function (we'll do this after model training).

# ## Making predictions on the test dataset
# 
# Since our model has been trained on images in the form of Tensor batches, to make predictions on test data, we'll have to get it into the same format.
# 
# Luckily we created `create_data_batches()` earlier, which can take a list of filenames as input and convert them into Tensor batches.
# 
# To predictions on the test data, we'll:
# * Get the test image filenames ‚úÖ
# * Convert the filenames into test data batches using `create_data_batches()` and setting the `test_data` parameter to `True` (since the test data doesn't have labels). ‚úÖ
# * Make a predictions array by passing the test batches to the `predict()` method called on our model. ‚úÖ

# %%
# Load test image filenames

# %%
# Create test data batch
test_data = create_data_batches(test_filenames, test_data=True)

# Make preds on test data batch using full model

# Save preds (NumPy array) to csv file (for access later)

# ## Preparing test dataset predictions for Kaggle
# Looking at the Kaggle sample submissio, we find that it wants our models prediction probability outputs in a DataFrame with an ID and a column for each different dof breed.
# 
# To get the data in this format, we'll:
# * Create a pandas DataFrame with an ID column as well as a column for each dog breed
# * Add data to the ID column by extractin the test image ID's from theri filepaths
# * Add data (the prediction probabilities) to each of the dog breed columns
# * Export the DataFrame as a CSV to submit it to Kaggle.

# %%
# Create a pandas DataFrame with empty columns
preds_df = pd.DataFrame(
    columns=["id"] + list(unique_breeds)
)
preds_df.head()

# %%
# Append test iamge ID's to predictions DataFrame
test_ids = [os.path.splitext(path)[0] for path in os.listdir(test_path)]
preds_df["id"] = test_ids
preds_df.head()

# %%
# Add the prediction probabilities to each dof breed column
preds_df[list(unique_breeds)] = test_predictions
preds_df.head()

# %%
preds_df.to_csv(

# ## Making predictions on custom images
# To make predictions on custom images, we'll:
# * Get filepaths of our own images.
# * Turn the filepaths into data bates using `create_data_batches()`. And since our custom images won't have labels, we set the `test_data` parameter to `True`.
# * Pass the custom image data bratch to our model's `predict()` method.
# * Convert the prediction output probabilities to prediction labels.
# * Compare the predicted labels to the custom images.

# %%
# Get custom image filepaths
custom_path = "C:/Selbststudium/Udemy/Udemy_ZTM_Data_Science/dog-breed/Own_images/"

# %%
# Get custom image prediction labels

# %%
# Get the custom images (unbatchify function work since there aren't labes... maybe we could fix this later)
custom_images = []
# Loop through unbatched data
for image in custom_data.unbatch().as_numpy_iterator():
    custom_images.append(image)

# %%
# Check custom image predictions
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
